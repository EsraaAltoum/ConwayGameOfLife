# ConwayGameOfLife

This game allows for a simulation of the conway game of life, where instances of generations occur throughout the cells within the grid. With each generation cells become alive, stay alive, or die following 4 rules. This continues for generations in order to create variations. 

This game can be run on any python environment (IDE, terminal ETC.)

In order to run the game for the specific case (where the user uses a separate file), a text file must me used.

The text file must consist of the first line being the height, the second being the width and the 3rd line and onwards be the actual grid.
